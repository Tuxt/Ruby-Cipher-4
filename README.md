# Ruby Cipher 4
Playing with Ruby and Shoes: An implementation of RC4

Normal version:
- main.rb
- RC4.rb
- Converter.rb

Progress version:
- main_progress.rb
- RC4_progress.rb
- Converter.rb

Normal version don't implements progress bar. Then, you can't see the progress while you encrypt big files.

Progress version implements a progress bar for file encryption.
That makes the process too slow.
